# Selected ML Algorithms

## Introduction
To analyze the social determinants of mental health and improve patient outcomes, appropriate machine learning algorithms need to be selected. This document lists the selected machine learning algorithms for this project.

## Selected Algorithms
1. Logistic Regression - A statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. In this case, it can be used to analyze the relationship between social determinants and mental health outcomes.

2. Decision Trees - A method that uses a tree-like graph to model decisions and their possible consequences. It can be used to identify the most important social determinants that affect mental health outcomes.

3. Random Forests - A method that uses multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy of predictions. It can be used to analyze complex relationships between social determinants and mental health outcomes.

4. Neural Networks - A method that simulates the way the human brain works to recognize patterns in data. It can be used to analyze large and complex datasets to identify the social determinants that affect mental health outcomes.

## Conclusion
These selected machine learning algorithms are suitable for analyzing the social determinants of mental health and improving patient outcomes. Training and validating these models can help to identify the most important social determinants and develop targeted interventions to improve mental health outcomes.
