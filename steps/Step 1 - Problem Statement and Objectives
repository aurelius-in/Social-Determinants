# Problem Statement and Objectives

The first step in developing a machine learning system for analyzing the social determinants of mental health and improving patient outcomes is to define the problem statement and objectives. We will work together to define these clearly, which will help us to identify the data sources required, the relevant variables, and the expected outcomes. In this case, our problem statement is to analyze the social determinants of mental health and their impact on patient outcomes.

We will ensure that our objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). By doing so, we can ensure that our efforts are focused and that we can measure our progress towards achieving our goals. Defining the problem statement and objectives will be a collaborative process involving various stakeholders, including healthcare providers, data analysts, and machine learning experts.
