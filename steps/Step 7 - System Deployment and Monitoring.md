# System Deployment and Monitoring

Once we have developed the system, we will deploy it in a production environment and monitor its performance regularly. The following steps will be taken:

1. Deploy the machine learning system in a production environment.
2. Monitor the system's performance regularly to ensure it is functioning correctly.
3. Update the system as new data becomes available and as the needs of the patient population change over time.
4. Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the system in achieving its objectives.
5. Refine the system based on the evaluation results and feedback from users.

By deploying and monitoring the machine learning system, we can ensure that it is functioning correctly and effectively improving patient outcomes. Continuously updating and refining the system will enable it to adapt to changing patient needs and provide the best possible care.
