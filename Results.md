After training and validating the machine learning models, we were able to identify several significant correlations between social determinants and mental health outcomes.

Using feature importance, we found that social factors such as income, education level, and employment status had a significant impact on mental health outcomes. Specifically, individuals with lower income and education levels were more likely to experience poor mental health outcomes.

Using partial dependence plots, we were able to visualize the relationship between different social determinants and mental health outcomes. For example, we found that as income levels increased, the likelihood of experiencing poor mental health outcomes decreased.

Using SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) values, we were able to quantify the impact of different social determinants on mental health outcomes. We found that social factors such as income, education level, and employment status had a greater impact on mental health outcomes than clinical factors such as age and gender.

Overall, our analysis suggests that social determinants have a significant impact on mental health outcomes, and that targeted interventions such as social support programs, educational campaigns, and mental health screenings for high-risk populations may be effective in improving patient outcomes.
