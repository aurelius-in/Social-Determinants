# Code Files

To train and validate machine learning models, the following Python files may be needed:

1. `scrape_data.py` - This file will scrape publicly-available data from any designated website, including those on our sources list.

2. `data_preprocessing.py` - This file will contain functions for loading, cleaning, transforming, and filtering the data to ensure that it is suitable for analysis.

3. `model_selection.py` - This file will contain functions for selecting the appropriate machine learning algorithms based on the data, problem statement, and expected outcomes.

4. `model_training.py` - This file will contain functions for training the selected machine learning models using the preprocessed data.

5. `model_evaluation.py` - This file will contain functions for evaluating the performance of the trained machine learning models using cross-validation techniques.

6. `interpretation.py` - This file will contain functions for interpreting the results of the trained machine learning models to identify the correlations between social determinants and mental health outcomes.

7. `intervention_development.py` - This file will contain functions for developing targeted interventions based on the results of the analysis.

8 `deployment.py` - This file will contain functions for deploying the system in a production environment and monitoring its performance regularly. 

Of course, the specific files needed may vary depending on the project requirements and the tools and frameworks being used.
