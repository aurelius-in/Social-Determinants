# Online Data to Gather

## Introduction
To develop a machine learning system for analyzing the social determinants of mental health and improving patient outcomes, relevant data from various sources is required. This document lists the online data sources that can be gathered for this project.

## Data Sources
1. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) - A program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.

2. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) - A system of health-related telephone surveys that collect data on health behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.

3. National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) - A survey that collects data on the use of illegal drugs, prescription drugs, alcohol, and tobacco in the United States.

4. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) - A federal agency that administers the Medicare program and works with states to administer Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

5. National Institutes of Health (NIH) - A medical research agency that conducts and supports research on the causes, treatments, and prevention of mental illness.

6. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) - A federal agency that works to improve the quality and availability of substance abuse prevention, addiction treatment, and mental health services in the United States.

7. World Health Organization (WHO) - A specialized agency of the United Nations that is concerned with international public health.

8. Open data portals - Many countries and cities have open data portals that provide access to various types of data, including demographic and health data.

## Conclusion
These online data sources provide a wealth of information on social determinants of mental health and patient outcomes. Gathering and preprocessing these data sources can help to develop a robust machine learning system that can analyze the social determinants of mental health and improve patient outcomes.
