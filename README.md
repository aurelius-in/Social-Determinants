# Developing a Machine Learning System for Analyzing the Social Determinants of Mental Health and Improving Patient Outcomes

## Description

This project aims to develop a machine learning system that analyzes the social determinants of mental health and improves patient outcomes. The system will use various machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in data related to social determinants of mental health and use these patterns to develop targeted interventions.
