# The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library interprets the machine learning model. 
# We first initialize a SHAP explainer object using the trained model. We then calculate 
# SHAP values for each feature in the dataset X. We use the summary_plot function to create 
# a summary plot of feature importance, which shows the top features that contribute to the 
# model's output. 

# We use the dependence_plot function to create a dependence plot for a selected feature, 
# which shows how the feature value affects the model output. 

# Finally, we use the force_plot function to create a force plot for a selected instance, 
# which shows how the features contribute to the model's output for that particular instance. 
# Modify for specific requirements.
