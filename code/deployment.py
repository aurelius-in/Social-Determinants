# If a pre-trained model has already been developed and saved to a file using the joblib 
# library this code will load the pre-trained model using the load function from the joblib library. 
# We then define a pre-processing pipeline that includes an imputer to handle missing values and a 
# scaler to standardize the data. We apply this pre-processing pipeline to the input data using the 
# fit_transform method. We then make predictions using the pre-trained model by calling the predict 
# method on the transformed data. Finally, we save the predictions to a CSV file with the patient IDs 
# and their corresponding predictions. You can modify this implementation based on the specific 
# requirements of your project, such as using a different pre-processing pipeline or outputting 
# predictions in a different format.
