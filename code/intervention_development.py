# we use the KMeans clustering algorithm to identify patient subgroups based on their features. 
# We first fit the KMeans model to the features feature_1, feature_2, and feature_3 in the data dataframe.
# We then assign cluster labels to each patient in the data dataframe based on the KMeans model. 

# We then loop through each unique cluster label and develop targeted interventions for that patient subgroup. 
# We develop two interventions for each patient subgroup: providing financial assistance to improve access to 
# healthcare, and developing mental health education programs. 

# Modify this implementation based on specific requirements, such as using different clustering algorithms 
# or developing different types of interventions.
